## Overview

Hello everyone :)  I would like to share with you my solution to the QR code component challenge from Frontend Mentor. It is a simple yet elegant QR code component that I built using SASS and Flexbox. I used SASS to write cleaner and more modular code, and Flexbox to create the layout. I hope you like it and I appreciate any feedback you may have. Thank you for your time and attention.
